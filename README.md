## Different Version

In this project I made the phone version, but I have also made a computer version:
- a phone version(kind of v.2): https://spanska.netlify.app/
- a computer version which simply reads the pressed keys spanskadatorn.netlify.app/ (https://github.com/DanielDarwiche/HangmanSpanish)
